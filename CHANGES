# Changes

## Releases from [chrisant996/clink](https://github.com/chrisant996/clink) fork

### v1.1.14

- Migrate settings and history from an old version of Clink, if present.  This only happens if the new-version Clink settings or history files don't exist.  (Deleting an existing new-version Clink settings or history file will cause migration to happen again.)
- Added `color.prompt` setting for backward compatibility with Clink v0.4.x.

### v1.1.13

- Fixed `clink.arg.register_parser` backward compatibility.

### v1.1.12

- Added `clink.ondisplaymatches()` as a replacement for the deprecated `clink.match_display_filter`.  The new API is able to support popup list windows as well.
- Speculative possible fix for [#35](https://github.com/chrisant996/clink/issues/35) Crash when clink on clink.bat.
- Fixed [#33](https://github.com/chrisant996/clink/issues/33) Tab autocomplete, auto-quoting paths doesn't seem to work as in Clink 0.4.9.

### v1.1.11

- Changed to load Lua scripts only once per session, unless forced to reload them.  This enables backward compatibility for things like [z.lua](https://github.com/skywind3000/z.lua) which has certain features that rely on Clink only loading scripts once per session.
- Added `clink.onbeginedit()` so scripts can register a callback function to be called each time the edit prompt is activated.
- Added `lua.reload_scripts` setting to optionally force reloading Lua scripts each time the edit prompt is activated.
- Added `color.message` setting for the Readline message area color (e.g. the search prompt message or digit argument prompt message, etc).
- Fixed stray sticky `=` appended to completions after typing `set ` and then typing a different command.

### v1.1.10

- Fixed [#32](https://github.com/chrisant996/clink/issues/32) hooking `ReadConsoleW` on Windows 7.

### v1.1.9

- Added backward compatibility for `clink.match_display_filter`.  The clink-completions/git.lua script uses it a lot, and that should all be working now.
- `settings.add` adds a color setting when the type is string and the name starts with "color.".
- `settings.get` now has an extra parameter to request the user friendly color name when getting a color setting.
- Added `clink.version_encoded` variable with the Clink version number as _MMmmmpppp_ (e.g. v1.1.9 is `10010009`) to make it easy for scripts to check for feature availability.
- The `clink info` command now shows Lua script paths as well.
- Fixed backward compatibility for loading scripts from the profile directory (if `clink.path` isn't set, then load scripts from the DLL directory and the profile directory).
- Fixed some `color.input` bleed through to other things (introduced in v1.1.5).
- Fixed scroll commands (regression introduced by input line color in v1.1.5).
- Fixed horizontally sorted match display and re-enabled the performance fix from v1.1.4.
- Fixed wildcard evaluation with non-file and non-directory matches (e.g. a branch name `origin/master` accidentally didn't match `or` or `*ma` because of the `/`).
- Fixed sort order of `foo\` vs `foo.bar\` when displaying matches or using the `menu-complete` family of commands.
- Fixed potentially-missing trailing path separator when `menu-complete` completes a directory match (regression introduced by wildcard matching in v1.1.5).
- Other obscure minor fixes.

### v1.1.8

- Fixed file match completions when an argmatcher only generates flag matches.
- Fixed automatic inferring whether Readline should use filename completion and/or display rules (regression introduced by backward compatibility in v1.1.3-alpha).
- Fixed backward compatibility for `clink.find_files()` and `clink.find_dirs()` (regression introduced by performance improvement in v1.1.7).
    - Ignore extra arguments after the first one (the performance improvement in v1.1.7 revealed that some scripts call `clink.find_files()` with extra invalid arguments; e.g. clink-completions/modules/matchers.lua).
    - Don't append a trailing path separator on directory names returned by these functions (the new `os.globfiles()` and `os.globdirs()` functions do, but the old `clink.find_files()` and `clink.find_dirs()` functions should not).
- Fixed backward compatibility for coloring matches (regression introduced by backward compatibility changes in v1.1.4).

### v1.1.7

- Performance improvement when displaying matches:  When enumerating files and dirs, the `os.globfiles` and `os.globdirs` functions have all the info about each file.  Now they can return that info in a table.  This frees the match display function from needing to do any further file system IO.  The performance boost is noticeable.
- Rewrote the color settings:  the .fg and .bg sub-settings are gone, and the main setting now uses a more natural syntax (e.g. `clink set color.input bright yellow` or `clink set color.modmark bright cyan on blue`).
- Added "cmd" match type for shell (CMD.EXE) command completions.
- Added VT emulation for the reverse video SGR parameters.
- Fixed tab completion for <code>clink set <em>setting</em></code>, and also handle the new color setting syntax.
- Fixed confusing behavior if multiple scripts try to add settings with the same name (now the first one succeeds and the rest report errors).

### v1.1.6

- Hooked up tilde completion in the `cd`, `md`, and `rd` command argmatchers.
- Hooked up tilde completion with the `exec.enable` setting ("~\pro" matches "C:\Users\myusername\program.exe").
- When `terminal.emulation` is `auto`, now it also detects ANSI{32|64}.DLL just like Clink 0.4.8 did.

### v1.1.5

- The `menu-complete` family of commands now support matching `?` and `*` wildcards when the `match.wild` setting is enabled.
- Added `colour.input` and `colour.modmark` settings for coloring Readline's input line.
- Added `clink.upper()` Lua function, and both `clink.lower()` and `clink.upper()` are properly UTF8 aware now.
- Added `clink-copy-word` command that copies the word at the cursor to the clipboard.
- Added `clink.promptfilter` setting to control whether to filter the prompt with Lua scripts.
- Renamed `terminal.emulate` setting to `terminal.emulation`.
- Improved executable file extension logic to consistently use %PATHEXT% (and efficiently).
- Improved file extension logic (e.g. "file.foo bar" has no extension because of the space).
- Updated arg matcher for `clink` itself (was missing some flags).
- Changed `colour.hidden` setting to not be set by default.
- Fixed [#28](https://github.com/chrisant996/clink/issues/28) Tab completion for "~" does not work.
- Fixed [#25](https://github.com/chrisant996/clink/issues/25) Unicode surrogate pairs (and emoji) input isn't working -- Microsoft Terminal renders the text correctly, but ConEmu and the default conhost still don't (and that isn't a Clink issue).
- Fixed screen size bug in Readline on Windows.
- Fixed the backwards values in the `terminal.emulation` setting.
- Fixed `....` so it works properly again.
- Fixed case sensitive sorting of matches.
- Fixed script error when %PATHEXT% is empty.
- Fixed the `exec.cwd` Clink setting to default to true, so that the default behavior is consistent with how v0.4.x behaved.
- Fixed the `cd`, `md`, `rd`, etc argmatchers to only match one argument to be consistent with the actual command syntax.

### v1.1.4

- Automatically detect when running inside ConEmu and disable Clink's Virtual Terminal emulation.
- Added `search-ignore-case` inputrc variable that makes the history search commands case insensitive.
- Suppress adding a space after completing a flag match that ends with `:` or `=` (e.g. `msbuild -maxCpuCount:`).
- Report any errors while loading Lua scripts.
- Report an error if a Lua script tries to add a flag string that begins with a letter.
- Fixed slow printing of possible matches.  Readline is inefficient about emitting output, so Clink supplies a custom implementation.
- Fixed some bugs in auto detection of flag prefix characters.
- Fixed backward compatibility for flags, and for args when merging two parsers by calling `clink.arg.register_parser('foo')` multiple times for the same command string.
- Fixed truncated message when the last line of a prompt exceeds 128 characters.
- Fixed abort (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>G</kbd> or <kbd>Esc</kbd>) in non-incremental history search mode.
- Fixed saved values for settings added by Lua scripts; now the saved value is available to the script immediately on adding the setting, and saved values are retained even if the setting isn't always added by the script.
- Fixed (and documented) shorthand form for defining an argmatcher.
- Fixed length of colored match prefix after a path separator.
- Fixed normalizing a slash by itself (`command /` mustn't become `command \` since that can interfere with completing flags).
- Fixed the `completion-auto-query-items` inputrc variable.
- Fixed the key binding list to correctly respect `completion-display-width`.
- _No visible effect yet:  internal change that parses the input line to identify colors to use for each word (command, argument, flag, etc), but the colors aren't yet applied to the input line._

### v1.1.3-alpha

- Fixed argmatcher lookup to be more strict, like in Clink 0.4.9 (match exact names, or name plus an extension from %PATHEXT%).
- Backward compatibility:
    - Most things should work now.
    - Dropping the new Clink on top of the vendor\clink directory in Cmder seems to work -- _but make a backup before you try this at home!_
- API changes:
    - Added `log.info()` function.
    - Added Clink version numbers in `clink.version_major`, etc.
    - Added `_argmatcher:getwordbreakinfo()` callback; removed `_argmatcher:setprefixincluded()` (it was a mess, and it was new to v1.x, so there's no compatibility concern with removing it).
    - Deprecated `_argmatcher:setflagprefix()`; now it happens automagically when using `_argmatcher:addflags()`.
    - Introduced several deprecated functions to support backward compatibility.
- Improvements to Lua debugger:
    - Added `lua.traceback_on_error`, `lua.break_on_error`, and `lua.break_on_traceback` settings to make debugging script errors easier.
    - Made `pause()` consistent about pausing in the caller (rather than sometimes inside the pause command itself).
    - The debugger automatically shows the stack trace when entering debug mode, and on every pause.
    - Show 3 lines of source context by default.
    - The help list is sorted now.
    - Fixed the `set` command in the debugger to behave as documented.

### v1.1.2-alpha

- Documentation is mostly updated; just the argmatcher Lua API and Clink command line options are left to be documented.
- Added `history.max_lines` setting that controls how many lines of command history to save (1 to 50000, default is 2500).
- Added `readline.hide_stderr` setting that can suppress stderr output from the Readline library.
- For backward compatibility with 0.4.8, `clink_inputrc` files are loaded as well.
- Lua script API changes:
    - `addmatch()` in Lua scripts takes an optional match type argument.
    - Removed `displayable`, `aux`, and `suffix` fields in matches.
    - Revert the change to disallow mixing file/directory/symlink with other match types (it broke the tests and certain completion scenarios).
- Fixed issues:
    - [#18](https://github.com/chrisant996/clink/issues/18) alt+digit then alt+ctrl+y isn't working.
    - [#17](https://github.com/chrisant996/clink/issues/17) arrow keys don't exit `reverse-search-history` like in bash.
    - [#16](https://github.com/chrisant996/clink/issues/16) problems with $T in doskey macros.
    - [#13](https://github.com/chrisant996/clink/issues/13) `clink history delete <n>` returns a CRT error.
- Other fixes:
    - There should be no more problems running on Windows Insider builds because Clink now uses [Detours](https://github.com/microsoft/detours) for hooking APIs.
    - Fixed crash in `insert-completions` due to heap failure (introduced by the performance changes for displaying matches).
    - Fixed `clink` and `history` built-in aliases (solve glitchy path problem).
    - Fixed scrolling to top of screen buffer.
    - Fixed env var and `set` completions.
    - Fixed `tilde-expand` for quoted text.
    - Fixed <kbd>Esc</kbd> in Readline's digit argument input mode (it doesn't try to cancel the mode, because that's not how Readline is documented to work).
    - Fixed exit code from some `clink` command line options.
- Set locale to UTF8 much earlier to avoid quirky behavior early in script processing.

### v1.1.1-alpha

- Exclusively use Readline's completion implementation.  This (with fixes and enhancements in Readline itself) makes the completion experience much nicer and more sophisticated, and removes a lot of code that was added in v1.0.0a0.
- Exclusively use Readline's key binding implementation.  This makes it possible to have a single consistent way to set key bindings (inputrc) and for `clink-show-help` to list all key bindings, and removes a lot of code that was added in v1.0.0a0.
- Converted all of Clink's internal key behaviors to be implemented as commands that can be bound in the inputrc file.
- Rewrote and refactored the pagination routine to be used in multiple places.
- Fixed prompt filtering to correctly use the specified priority order.
- Readline library:
    - Updated the Readline library from v6.2 to v8.0.  This picked up lots of bug fixes and new capabilities (for example colored completions).
    - Changed Readline to support backslash as a path separator.
    - The pager prompt in Readline is optionally colored, controlled by the `colour.interact` Clink setting.
    - Added `completion-auto-query-items` config variable (on by default) which asks whether to list possible matches when the number of lines listed will fill one screen page.
    - Added `history-point-at-end-of-anchored-search` config variable in inputrc to make the cursor point behave like 4Dos/4NT/TakeCommand when searching forward and backward through command history.
    - Fixed prev history at top of history.
    - Fixed to get the current values of environment variables when needed, rather than always getting the value from whenever Clink was started.
    - Fixed coloring directory completions.
    - Fixed `menu-complete` for `\dir` and `.` and `..`.
    - Fixed slow performance when displaying matches.  Readline was calling stat() at least once per match (!!).  A new match type field enables faster performance, coloring readonly and hidden file matches, applying filename completion rules only to filenames (vs branch names or other text strings), correct match de-duplication, and more.  The Lua match APIs can supply the new match type.
    - Fixed inserting a completion to happen as a single undo group.
    - Fixed tilde to map to `%USERPROFILE%` instead of `%APPDATA%` on Windows.
- Typing a directory by itself uses `cd /d` to change to the directory:
    - Typing a directory with a trailing path separator changes to the directory.
    - Typing `..\` changes to the parent directory.
    - Typing `...` or `....` etc moves up an extra parent directory level for each extra dot (2 dots move up one parent, 3 dots moves up two parents, etc).  A trailing path separator is optional when there are more than 2 dots.
    - Typing `-` or `cd -` or `chdir -` changes to the previous directory.
- Commands that are new, enhanced, or fixed:
    - Added `add-history` and `remove-history` commands (similar to 4Dos/4NT/TakeCommand).
    - Got the `menu-complete`, `menu-complete-backward`, and `old-menu-complete` commands working (they never worked properly before in Clink).
        - Also added a corresponding `old-menu-complete-backward` command for reverse order.
        - All of the `*-menu-complete-*` commands support wildcards (`*` and `?`).
    - Added `clink-show-help` command (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd>).  The help now lists _**all**_ key bindings, and it shows user-friendly key names (like `A-Up` or `C-x,C-r` or `C-S-PgUp` or `A-C-S-F3`).
    - Added `clink-popup-completions` command that shows a popup window listing possible completions.  <kbd>Enter</kbd> inserts the highlighted completion.
    - Added `clink-popup-directories` command that shows a popup window listing recent directories.  <kbd>Enter</kbd> changes to the highlighted directory, or <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> inserts the highlighted directory in the editing line (or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>).
    - Added `clink-popup-history` command that shows a popup window listing command history.  <kbd>Enter</kbd> executes the highlighted command, or <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> jumps to the highlighted command in the history (or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>).
    - Added `clink-scroll-lineup`, `clink-scroll-linedown`, `clink-scroll-page-up`, `clink-scroll-page-down`, `clink-scroll-top`, and `clink-scroll-bottom` commands that do what it looks like they'd do and are bound to the keys it looks like they'd be.
    - Added `clink-expand-doskey` command (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>f</kbd>) that expands the current line according to the current doskey aliases.
    - Added `clink-expand-env-var` command (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>e</kbd>) that expands the environment variable at the cursor point.
    - Added `clink-exit` command (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F4</kbd>) that exits CMD.
- Fixed keyboard input issues:
    - <kbd>Esc</kbd> is a bindable key now (`\e[27;27~`).
    - Added more bindable key combinations (run `clink echo` then press keys to see the key sequence to use in the inputrc file).
    - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>@</kbd> (NUL) didn't work.
    - <kbd>Ins</kbd> toggles insert/overwrite mode.
    - Unbound keys are ignored now, instead of inserting gibberish characters (part of the terminal internal key sequence).
    - Fixed input handling so the `quoted-insert` command can work properly.
    - Fixed <kbd>Esc</kbd> while searching.
    - Fixed vi mode (was working in v0.4.9, but not in v1.0.x).
- Fixed command history issues:
    - The `dont_add_to_history_cmds` Clink setting is a space-delimited list of commands to not add to history.
    - Fixed bleeding between history banks.
    - Fixed uninitialized variable that made history updates intermittently do nothing or corrupt the other history bank.
    - Fixed output from `clink history` to convert to UTF16 when writing to the console (but write UTF8 when output is redirected).
- Fixed terminal output issues:
    - Added `terminal.emulate` Clink setting that controls whether Clink does VT emulation or passes all ANSI escape codes directly to the console host.  For example, this lets the prompt and completion coloring take advantage of more sophisticated ANSI escape codes such as XTerm 256 color and 16 bit color support.
    - Added back support for the `prefer-visible-bell` config variable.
    - Fixed underline support.
    - Fixed handling for UTF8 output from Readline.
    - Fixed invisible cursor point in Lua debugger.
- Completions:
    - Added `match.sort_dirs` Clink setting that specifies where to sort directories in the list of possible completions:  before files, mixed in with files, or after files.
    - Don't attempt completing incomplete UNC paths:  at least the `\\server\share\` path components are required (for anything shorter the OS APIs are guaranteed to fail, but will fail slowly).
    - Fixed sorting to use Unicode aware locale based sorting (like Windows does) instead of dumb UTF8 byte comparisons.
    - Fixed arbitrary limit on completions (had been limited to 64KB worth of completions).
    - Fixed quoting spaces in completions.
    - Fixed to use the same list as CMD for characters that require quoting.
    - Fixed normalizing UNC paths.
    - Fixed volume relative completions (e.g. `x:foo`).
    - Disallow mixing file/directory/symlink with other match types.  This was to avoid a confusing/malfunctioning case in match display and prefix highlighting.
- Fixed UTF8 encoding in various Lua functions.
- Fixed printing stderr output from Readline, Lua, and Clink.
- Fixed crashes and other failures when starting Clink in 32 bit CMD.
- Fixed some memory leaks that accumulated with each new line of input.
- Fixed prompt filtering API to be backward compatible with v0.4.9 scripts.
- Fixed Lua errors from `clink set` (it neglected to fully initialize Clink's Lua integration before loading Lua scripts).
- Fixed UTF8 conversion bug that could truncate a string without fully converting it.
- Fixed serious rampant memory corruption bug in v1.0.x (not present in v0.4.9), which had been causing intermittent malfunctions and data corruption and crashes.
- Fixed multi-line doskey macros to show the prompt in between lines, like CMD does.
- Removed the 4096 byte limit on input.
- Renamed the Clink DLL back to what it was in v0.4.x, to fix compile time problems.
- Other fixed issues:
